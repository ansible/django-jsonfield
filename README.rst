django-jsonfield
===================

I had a serious need for a JSON field for django. There were a couple out
there, but none packaged up nicely on bitbucket/github that were usable
with ``pip install -e``.

So I took the code from `David Cramer's blog`_, and packaged it up.

To use, just install the package, and then use the field::


    from django.db import models
    import jsonfield
    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        the_json = jsonfield.JSONField()
    
Now, it will validate the JSON on entry, and store it as a string in the
database.  When you instantiate/fetch the object, it will be turned back
into a python list/dict/string.

There are also a couple of other bits and bobs:

- jsonify templatetag:
  This allows you to convert a python data structure into JSON within a template.

    {% load jsonify %}
    
    <script>
    var foo = {{ bar|jsonify }};
    </script>
  
- JSONTableWidget
  I strongly recommend you don't use this: it's an experimental way of having
  a generic JSON structure represented as a table, enabling you to let non-programmer
  types edit JSON data.
  I have replaced a lot of the code that is here with some new KnockoutJS-based
  stuff, and that simplifies it a whole lot. As such, I am not using this widget
  any longer, and it may not work.

History
----------
* 0.7.1 : Don't fail when trying to install before django is installed.
* 0.7 : First time I tagged releases.


Todo
----------

Convert date/time objects nicely to/from ISO strings (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS 
TZNAME). This is actually a bit tricky, as we don't know if we are expecting
a date/time object. We may parse objects as we go, but there could be
some performance issues with this.
